# Implementation
KL2PEN is built using a modern and scalable tech stack:

- **Firebase**: Handles authentication (Firebase Auth), file storage (Cloud Storage), data management (Firestore), and app hosting (App Hosting).
- **Gemini via Firebase GenKit**: Provides AI-powered services like resume analysis and career suggestions through a middleware approach.
- **React + Next.js**: Powers the frontend with dynamic routing and SSR for optimal performance.
- **Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui**: Used for clean, responsive UI with accessible and consistent design components.
- **LangChain PDF Loader**: Extracts content from resumes and sends it to Gemini for intelligent analysis.
- **Next.js Server Actions**: Adds a security and validation layer before communicating with Firebase or Gemini.

# Challenges Faced

## Optimization Issues
We initially used the `fetch` JavaScript function to call the Gemini API directly. However, this approach quickly became messy and hard to maintain, especially when sharing the code across team members. To resolve this, we removed the direct API calls and replaced them with Firebase GenKit, which provides a ready-made and scalable solution. This decision significantly reduced our codebase—from nearly 500 lines to under 100—and improved maintainability and readability.

## Continuous Deployment
We also encountered difficulties setting up continuous deployment. Our goal was to automatically deploy the website whenever there were new commits to the `main` branch. Manually writing and testing a GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD was time-consuming and prone to errors. To simplify the process, we switched to **Firebase AppHosting**, which offers automatic CI/CD integration with GitHub. This allowed us to deploy the site seamlessly without manual intervention, saving development time and effort.
